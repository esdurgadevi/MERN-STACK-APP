## Backend
- To set the package.json in backend to run the command
```java
npm init -y
```
- Then set the express we want to install express so run the below command
```java
npm install express
```
- The starting point of the server is server.js in the backend folder so we start the express server in that file and then add the listen function so the server is listen the correct port to run the backend server we run node then file name. but this will not automatically restart if the change occur in the server so if we use nodemon the updates are automatically dedect and the server restart automatically so first install nodemon and then use nodemon server.js.
